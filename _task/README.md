# Address Book Challenge

The aim of this challenge is to build a simple Angular app to demonstrate how to work with a basic form and API. In this folder
is a .NET 8.0 application. If you run it either from an IDE or by typing (you will need .NET 8.0 installed):

    dotnet run

A web service with a Swagger / OpenAPI document will be started (it should start at http://localhost:5062 but check the
console) that you can use to develop against. CORS should be enabled for browser requests from http://localhost:4200.

Using this API please look to demonstrate how to build a form that

1. Creates a new address
2. Gets an address given an ID as a route parameter

Please note we are not looking for an exhaustive "perfect" or complete solution, instead please think of this as a basis
for demonstrating how you would:

1. Break down a simple screen into components
2. Apply styling
3. Consider responsive design
3. Validate inputs
4. Call an API
5. Use a state manager (if you think that is appropriate)
6. Handle errors
7. Go about testing
8. Anything else you feel is important!
